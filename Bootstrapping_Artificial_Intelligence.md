## Bootstrapping Artificial Intelligence: Grounding and Metaprogramming
### SAIGON: A Unified Graph Theoretic Model for Narrow Artificial Intelligence and Artificial General Intelligenec

Yampolskiy (2018) gave a comprehensive review on ...

Our hypothesis: bottleneck in AGI was due to lack of knowledge in Stack Machine, reverse polish notation, graph theory, graph database (4 areas, discuss in depths).

One most crucial factor: Homoiconicity -- program can be analyse as data, due to its simple structure. 99% or more of existing programs are NOT homoiconic. Knowledge of homoiconicity is rare. Too rare. Even Forth programmers are not concerned about this issue.

Proof: Human language is homoiconic; Stack machine is simplest machine; Human brain could operate like a stack machine -- which is conceived by human brain; Try to prove it, contrary or otherwise, proving process will show truth.

We propose modifications to the Turing Test based on techniques derived from graph theory. More specifically, 

(i) Turing Test is generalized to a suite of enumerable tests, i.e. Enumerated Turing Tests.

(ii) A graph database model is proposed to represent and implement the enumerated Turing Tests.

(iii) The proposed graph database is homoiconic and self evaluating, comprising not only knowledge and goals, but also functions or code to satisfy given goals, based on stack machine architecture.

We believe our approach satisfies 
the principle of Occam's razor, as it does not require exotic theories to model AI ranging from Narrow AI to AGI. 

Occam's razor also implies that, by making efforts or tests to change its conditions, a different outcome may be achieved. Since Occam's razor requires least effort, therefore the effort invested to change the outcome will also be minimal. In this case, the parameter to measure will be the number of programmers who understand SAIGON, versus the output they can produce towards achieving AGI, measurable on a monthly basis.

Further, we outline a practical plan to achieve AGI within finite time using finite resources, which we believe to be an unprecedented proposal.

The adventure to find the secret recipes of AGI is perhaps unprecedented in mankind's history. The closest analogy is perhaps the invention of the transistor, which ushered in the age of electronics. The biggest difference is that, the number of researchers and programmers capable of making the breakthrough in AGI is much larger than those during the the invention of the transistor. As such, it may seem odd that AGI formula is NOT discovered sooner.
