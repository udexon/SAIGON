## Bootstrapping Artificial Intelligence: Grounding and Metaprogramming
### SAIGON: A Unified Graph Theoretic Model for Narrow Artificial Intelligence and Artificial General Intelligenec

Yampolskiy (2018) gave a comprehensive review on ...

We propose modifications to the Turing Test based on techniques derived from graph theory. More specifically, 

(i) Turing Test is generalized to a suite of enumerable tests, i.e. Enumerated Turing Tests.

(ii) A graph database model is proposed to represent and implement the enumerated Turing Tests.

(iii) The proposed graph database is homoiconic and self evaluating, comprising not only knowledge and goals, but also functions or code to satisfy given goals, based on stack machine architecture.

We believe our approach satisfies 
the principle of Occam's razor, as it does not require exotic theories to model AI ranging from Narrow AI to AGI. 

Further, we outline a practical plan to achieve AGI within finite time using finite resources, which we believe to be an unprecedented proposal.

The adventure to find the secret recipes of AGI is perhaps unprecedented in mankind's history. The closest analogy is perhaps the invention of the transistor, which ushered in the age of electronics. The biggest difference is that, the number of researchers and programmers capable of making the breakthrough in AGI is much larger than those during the the invention of the transistor. As such, it may seem odd that AGI formula is NOT discovered sooner.
