### "Man in the Mirror" Experiment: Bootstraping AI with SAIGON Kotlin OpenCV

\[ [Table of Contents](https://github.com/udexon/SAIGON/blob/master/0_Table_of_Contents.md) \]

The "Man in the Mirror" Experiment (MitM) consists of at least 2 Android mobile phones (devices), running SAIGON OpenCV image processing program, "looking at each other". By "looking at each other", the "gounding problem" is addressed via the graph database mechanism in SAIGON, which includes relationships of "self" and "others", as well as the ability "to analyze its own code", based on the homoiconic nature of SAIGON's reverse Polish notation.

MitM could also run on other platforms, such as Linux, MacOS, iOS or Windows, depending on implementation resources and schedules for respetive platforms.

The following articles illustrate the basic principles of SAIGON and MitM:
