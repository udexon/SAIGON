### "Man in the Mirror" Experiment: Bootstraping AI with SAIGON Kotlin OpenCV

\[ [Table of Contents](https://github.com/udexon/SAIGON/blob/master/0_Table_of_Contents.md) \]

The "Man in the Mirror" Experiment (MitM) consists of at least 2 Android mobile phones (devices), running SAIGON OpenCV image processing program, "looking at each other". In this experiment, we attempt to simulate the sensation and thought process when a man (woman) looks at himself (herself) in the mirror. 

The "gounding problem" is addressed via the graph database mechanism in SAIGON, which includes relationships of "self" and "others", as well as the ability "to analyze its own code", based on the homoiconic nature of SAIGON's reverse Polish notation.

MitM could also run on other platforms, such as Linux, MacOS, iOS or Windows, depending on implementation resources and schedules for respetive platforms.

The following articles illustrate the basic principles of SAIGON and MitM:

One of the biggest problems in Android application programming is the complexity of the toolchain and programming languages. We estimate it could take at least 6 months for a newbie (without any programming experience) to learn the basic concepts. Besides, after going through the "nightmare" of installing Android Studio and relevant tools, to compile a simple "Hello World" program would consume upwards of hundreds of MB of updates, with at least 10 minutes of wait time.

The [SAIGON AJAX example](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/fgl.html) illustrates how complex JavaScript and PHP functions can be executed in SAIGON stack machine framework using reverse Polish notation (RPN), one of the oldest yet simplest programming language, whose simplicity is testified by generations of reverse Polish calculators, on par with the ubiquitous spreadsheet.

The JavaScript module of the SAIGON AJAX example demonstrates the Inverse Shunting Yard Algorithm (ISYA), the inverse of Dijkstra's classic shunting yard algorithm (DSYA), illustrating how reverse Polish notation can be implemented in ANY known programming language in about 50 lines of JavaScript or PHP code, making it an ideal candidate as a universal interface script, to implement a Stack Machine Shell (SMASH) in any host programming language.

As such, SAIGON's RPN, known as 5GL (Fifth Generation Graph Language, as a pun to the Forth programming language), can be an ideal choice for beginners to master Android programming, as SAIGON 5GL can be ported to any programming language within the Android platform.

However, a unified programming language on Android is only half the story -- configuration files are the other half of the nightmare. To address this problem, SAIGON is born:
