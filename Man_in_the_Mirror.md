### "Man in the Mirror" Experiment: Bootstraping AI with SAIGON Kotlin OpenCV

\[ [Table of Contents](https://github.com/udexon/SAIGON/blob/master/0_Table_of_Contents.md) \]

The "Man in the Mirror" Experiment (MitM) consists of at least 2 Android mobile phones (devices), running SAIGON OpenCV image processing program, "looking at each other". In this experiment, we attempt to simulate the sensation and thought process when a man (woman) looks at himself (herself) in the mirror. 

The "gounding problem" is addressed via the graph database mechanism in SAIGON, which includes relationships of "self" and "others", as well as the ability "to analyze its own code", based on the homoiconic nature of SAIGON's reverse Polish notation.

MitM could also run on other platforms, such as Linux, MacOS, iOS or Windows, depending on implementation resources and schedules for respetive platforms.

The following articles illustrate the basic principles of SAIGON and MitM:

- [SAIGON AJAX Example](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/fgl.html)

One of the biggest problems in Android application programming is the complexity of the toolchain and programming languages. We estimate it could take at least 6 months for a newbie (without any programming experience) to learn the basic concepts. Besides, after going through the "nightmare" of installing Android Studio and relevant tools, to compile a simple "Hello World" program would consume upwards of hundreds of MB of updates, with at least 10 minutes of wait time.

The [SAIGON AJAX Example](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/fgl.html) illustrate how complex JavaScript and PHP functions can be executed in SAIGON stack machine framework using reverse Polish notation (RPN), one of the oldest yet simplest programming language, whose simplicity is testified by several generations of reverse Polish calculators, on par with the ubiquitous spreadsheet.
