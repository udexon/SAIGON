### Beyond Deep Learning: Homoiconic Graph Metaprogramming



Despite recent advances in deep learning, there has been relatively few attempts at Artificial General Intelligence, let alone promising progress towards it. 

We identify two areas in artificial intelligence research that are critical for achieving AGI:

- symbol grounding problem
- metaprogramming

To address these drawbacks, we propose a solution based on graph theory called SAIGON, that encompasses the following components:

- graph database
- homoiconic metaprogramming

Beyond Deep Learning: Artificial Intelligence Metaprogramming

Symbol grounding problem. Graph database.
