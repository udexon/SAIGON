### Beyond Deep Learning: Homoiconic Graph Metaprogramming

\[ [Table of Contents](https://github.com/udexon/SAIGON/blob/master/0_Table_of_Contents.md) \]

Despite recent advances in deep learning, there has been relatively few attempts at Artificial General Intelligence, let alone promising progress towards it. 

We identify two areas in artificial intelligence research that are critical for achieving AGI:

- symbol grounding problem
- metaprogramming

To address these drawbacks, we propose a solution based on graph theory called SAIGON, that encompasses the following components:

- graph database
- homoiconic metaprogramming

The symbol grounding problem concerns mechanisms by which we associate meaning to a word. e.g. the sun, "come here", "go there", ... etc. In our humble opinion, there do not seem to be viable and practical theories or proposals to solve this problem. We propose SAIGON, a "homoiconic graph machine", with the hope to prove its viability by exhaustive negation, i.e. it is valid if we we cannot find test cases to negate it.
