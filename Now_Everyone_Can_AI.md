## Now Everyone Can Program AI and *Own A Piece of It*!!

As computer programming increasingly become a core curricula around the world, teenagers everywhere begin coding for various robotic and artificial intelligence projects.

However, beyond the initial excitement engulfing teachers and students, few people understand and are willing to discuss the widening knowledge gaps between supermega corporations and individual programmers -- forming the latest, perhaps the most dangerous type of class struggle.

We introduce SAIGON (Stack Machine Artificial Intelligence Graph Object Notation) and Cloudias (Cloud *Intelligence Artificielle* SAIGON), easy to learn programming methods that can be traced back to the reverse Polish calculators and as simple as the Excel spreadsheet, so that everyone can learn to program AI, *AND OWN A PIECE OF THE IT*.

The very reason that everyone can "own a piece of AI" is due to the fact that SAIGON can be hosted on every piece of mobile device (phones, watches, game consoles included), with merely a few hundred lines of code -- thanks to the beauty of the stack machine architecture. This is a lost art that has been missing in the propaganda by supermega corporations, preferring to promote "cloud computing" solutions which make users more dependent on them, instead of empowering the users.
