### Making GitHub Flavored Markdown A Hybrid of Blogs and Technical Publications

Necessity is the mother of invention. GitHub Flavored MarkDown (GFM) was perhaps never intended as a replacement for blogs. However, its features and the control it provides to programmers make it our favourite. A minor innovation such as this `0_Table_of_Contents.md`, in addition to the ubiquitous `README.md`, goes a long way to enhance GitHub Flavored MarkDown, becoming a hybrid platform for blogs (short) and technical publications (long), combining the best of both worlds.

Technical publications are usually lengthy and have lots of details. On top of that, they are usually written with specific types of readers. By breaking down the contents of a long technical publication into multiple short markdown articles, each short markdown section can be aimed at a specific type of readers, besides speeding up the publication. The markdown articles can also be packaged as a long technical article for different types of readers.
